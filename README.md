## System environment dependencies installation

Building `DW` requires both a Go (version 1.13 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Expï¼šcentos 8

* yum update -y && yum install gcc-c++ epel-release nodejs cmake -y

* rpm -ivh http://mirrors.wlnmp.com/centos/wlnmp-release-centos.noarch.rpm

  yum -y install wntp

* yum -y install golang

## Executables

The DW project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

| Command | Description                                                  |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   DW    | Our main YINIU CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `DW --help` and the [CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/DW/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |

## Running DW

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here,
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own DW instance.

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use-case the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can
fast-sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```shell
$ DW console
```

This command will:
 * Start DW in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up `DW`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/DW/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as `DW`'s own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/DW/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `DW` instance with `DW attach`.

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `DW` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ DW --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

### Programmatically interfacing DW nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `DW` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, DW has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC)
and [`DW` specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/DW/wiki/Management-APIs)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `DW`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `DW` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "dpos": {
        "period": 10,
        "epoch": 60,
        "maxValidatorsCount": 21,
        "minDelegatorBalance": 40000000,
        "minCandidateBalance": 40000000,
        "validators": [
        	            "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
        	            "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
      	                "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
        	            ]
    }
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x20000",
  "extraData": "",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00"
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

the DW DPOS ` fields:

```json
"dpos": {
    "period": 10,                     // Number of seconds between blocks to enforce
    "epoch": 60,                      // Epoch length to reset votes and checkpoint
    "maxValidatorsCount": 21,         // Max count of validators
    "minDelegatorBalance": 40000000,  // Min delegator balance to valid this delegate
    "minCandidateBalance": 40000000,  // Min candidate balance to valid this candidate
    "validators": [                   // Genesis validator list
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
    ]
}
```



With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`DW` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ DW init path/to/genesis.json
```

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `DW`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ DW --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*

#### Running a private miner

Mining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it's only feasible using GPUs,
requiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `ethminer` instance. For information on such a
setup, please consult the [EtherMining subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)
and the [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) repository.

In a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for
practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals
without needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple
ones either). To start a `DW` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended
by:

```shell
$ DW <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all
proceedings to the account specified by `--etherbase`. You can further tune the mining
by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--targetgaslimit`) and the price
transactions are accepted at (`--gasprice`).
